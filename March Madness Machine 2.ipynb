    "This notebook is an attempt to predict March Madness brackets through the methods of machine learning. The tournament starts in less than two weeks from the start of this project, so one goal is to keep it simple. There is limited time for in-depth analysis and exploration. It is through this experiment I hope to be able to use very limited information to build a simplified model that still produces results. It seems that very often March Madness models are created that try to examine every excruciating detail and statistic to perfectly predict the outcomes. This is impossible. There are too many unknowns in the world of sports, especially March Madness, to create a model with perfect prediction. Most of the time, this leads to overfitting. Instead, I aim to experiment on the ability of a simple model to perform in a complicated world. Instead of looking for every possible detail, to create a quick and simple model to perform better than the average, educated NCAA basketball fan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a prediction method is created, it will be tested against other \"testing\" brackets. I will create two brackets will little knowledge about NCAA basketball. The two brakets will mainly consist of picking based on seeds, while accounting for some upsets. These will be the \"guess\" brackets. Next, I will create two more brackets after carefully examining expert opinions and rankings. These will be the \"educated guess\" brackets. Finally I will pick the two best models from the experiment and create two brackets from the results accordingly. I will them examine which brackets perform the best, seeing if the randomness of march madness can create chaos within the experiment. The results remain to be seen."
