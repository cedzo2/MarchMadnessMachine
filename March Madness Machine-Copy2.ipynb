    "This notebook is an attempt to predict March Madness brackets through the methods of machine learning. The tournament starts in less than two weeks from the start of this project, so one goal is to keep it simple. There is limited time for in-depth analysis and exploration. It is through this experiment I hope to be able to use very limited information to build a simplified model that still produces results. It seems that very often March Madness models are created that try to examine every excruciating detail and statistic to perfectly predict the outcomes. This is impossible. There are too many unknowns in the world of sports, especially March Madness, to create a model with perfect prediction. Most of the time, this leads to overfitting. Instead, I aim to experiment on the ability of a simple model to perform in a complicated world. Instead of looking for every possible detail, to create a quick and simple model to perform better than the average, educated NCAA basketball fan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a prediction method is created, it will be tested against other \"testing\" brackets. I will create two brackets will little knowledge about NCAA basketball. The two brakets will mainly consist of picking based on seeds, while accounting for some upsets. These will be the \"guess\" brackets. Next, I will create two more brackets after carefully examining expert opinions and rankings. These will be the \"educated guess\" brackets. Finally I will pick the two best models from the experiment and create two brackets from the results accordingly. I will them examine which brackets perform the best, seeing if the randomness of march madness can create chaos within the experiment. The results remain to be seen."

    "So far, the model is performing with respectable accuracy. With predictions averaging ~76%, this is most likely as high as it will get before the start of March Madness. There is potential for higher accuracy, but most would require more time than is available for me before the tournement. \n",
    "\n",
    "One problem, however, is that I believe the model is too predictable. March Madness is known for its unpredictability. I don't think there are many scenarios within a machine learning model that would ever give a 16 seed a higher chance to win than against a 1 seed. Even with this said, it HAS happened in March Madness before. Along the same lines, even though in almost every case, a 2 seed would be considered an almost assured win against a 15 seed, but historically, a 15 seed upsets a 2 seed around 6.3% of the time. The percentage chance of upsets only goes up from there. This is where I see a problem with my model. When testing it against historical data, it will get most of the \"expected\" games correctly, but the better team doesn't always win. There are a multitude of factors that are almost completely hidden going into a game, such as how certain players are feeling on game day, or just strokes of luck throughout a game for a certain team. Sometimes shots just seem to make the basket more often than usual on some days. Some players just happen to play better during the playoffs a particular year. Then there are also noticeably unpredictable factors, such as player injuries, sickness, or referee decisions. These are the types of factors that can lead to results going against a model which doesn't include these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I will create a bracket that uses the direct predictions from the model, I already assume it will miss a large amount of upsets, as it appears to be giving too much bias towards generally stronger teams. In order to try to combat this, I want to add an element of randomness into the model predictions. I want to craft it in a way that pays attention to historical data on how often upsets occur. My first idea was to use a random number generator to generate a random number from 0-1 for each game played. Then, I would compare this number to the percent chance team 1 wins the game. If the generated number is less than the predicted number, then the prediction would output that team 1 will win the game. I may still use this idea, but I wanted to take it a little further to protect against too unpredictable of a model and keep in mind historical data. My idea for this was to instead not make the generated numbers completely random, but to make them follow a normal distribution, tuned to the average historical predictions of seeding with the models predictions based on seed. By first starting with a normal distribution of mean 0.5, I can then adjust the standard deviation to create a pseudo-randomness that models historical upset data with my models predictions. For example, if the 15 seed upsets the 2 seed ~6.3% of the time, then my model should roughly output a win from the 15 seed, even if it sees the 2 seed as a better team 6-7% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am not sure on my thoughts for this method yet. It is essentially telling my model to not trust its predictions a certain number of times, but I think that it is needed to produce a bracket with enough upsets, because it is not a strong enough model to predict the essentially unpredictable elements of March Madness.
